# Description (Project Summary)
The new platform, MyWonder, can perform big data analytics and visualizations from massive files. Previously, in order to analyze and visualize the massive files, the users need to wait for hours. However, we distribute the files on the cloud to improve efficiency and reduce waiting time. Now, MyWonder can not only help the users calculate their analytic and summary from their phone, even before they join the meeting and create visualizations from large files easily but also reduce executing and visualizing time from hours to under ten minutes.
